# Step 1 – Install Node.js

Head on over to http://nodejs.org and click install – this should use magic to figure out what OS and version.

# Step 2 – Install Gulp.js

gulp-2x Open command prompt – (run cmd) then type `npm` – if there is no  error you’ve installed Node.js correctly yay! Otherwise make sure you close and reopen command prompt if it was open during install. Or try rebooting – reinstalling, the usual.

Now type `npm install -g gulp` this will install Gulp.js globally on your system. It will enable you to run the `gulp` command in your command prompt.

You will now need to go `npm install gulp` to locally install Gulp to your project root directory. You’ll have to do this for each new project where you wish to use Gulp.

Type `gulp` it should say no gulpfile found this means its installed correctly.
